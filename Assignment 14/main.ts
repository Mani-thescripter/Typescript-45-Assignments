// Question 14: 
/*Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, 
who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d

inviting them to dinner.*/

let invitedGuests : string[] = ["Jamaal","Kamaal","Zawaal"];


 for  (let i=0; i<invitedGuests.length; i++)
     {
        console.log(`Hello ${invitedGuests[i]}, You are invited to join us on our dinner`)

invitedGuests.forEach (invitedGuests => {

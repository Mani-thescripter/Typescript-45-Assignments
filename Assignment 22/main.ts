//Question 22: 
//Intentional Error: Try to produce an array index error in one of your programs. Correct the error before finishing.

//Lets Code😉❗

let countries: string[] = ["Japan", "Canada", "New Zealand", "Iceland", "Switzerland"]
console.log (countries[6]);  //intentional error happened. cuz we print index number 6 which is not in an array
console.log(countries[1] = "Canada")
